# Logging In

***

In order to write, view or print evaluations a user first needs to log in. This is accomplished from the Login form. The Login form is accessed via the Login - Login menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

The Login form will automatically appear when Expectations first starts up, when a database connection is made, or when a user logs out. _Expectations installs with a single Trainer/Supervisor account, the Login Name being "Admin" and the Password "password"_. To log in, enter the Login Name, Password and User Type in the appropriate boxes and select the OK button. User information appears on the status bar at the bottom of the [main form](7jjr.md) and the menus are reconfigured to accommodate the user's [security level](7gj4.md). The Cancel button will close the Login form without logging in.

When Expectations is unable to establish a database connection at startup the login form will not appear. In this case use the File - Open Database menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md) to manually establish a connection. Once the connection is made to the database the Login form will appear.
