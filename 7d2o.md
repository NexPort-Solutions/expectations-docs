# Logging In 
| --- |

In order to write, view or print evaluations a user first needs to log in.&nbsp; 
This is accomplished from the Login form.&nbsp; The Login form is accessed via the 
Login - Login menu item on the [main form](<7jjr.md>).

The Login form will automatically appear when Expectations first starts up, 
when a database connection is made, or when a user logs out.&nbsp; *Expectations installs with a single Trainer/Supervisor account, the Login Name being "Admin" and the Password "password"*.&nbsp; To log in, enter the Login 
Name, Password and User Type in the appropriate boxes and select the OK button.&nbsp; 
User information appears on the status bar at the bottom of the
[main form](<7jjr.md>) and the menus are reconfigured to 
accommodate the user's [security level](<7gj4.md>).&nbsp; 
The Cancel button will close the Login form without logging in.

When Expectations is unable to establish a database connection at startup the 
login form will not appear.&nbsp; In this case use the File - Open Database menu item 
on the [main form](<7jjr.md>) to manually establish a connection.&nbsp; 
Once the connection is made to the database the Login form will appear.
