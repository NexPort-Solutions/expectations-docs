The View/Print Criteria Set form allows existing criteria sets to be reviewed 
and printed.&nbsp; To bring up the form, select the Trainer/Supervisor - View/Print Criteria Set 
menu item on the [main form](<7jjr.md>).

The View/Print Criteria Set Screen is framed into three areas which are 
labeled Select, View and Print.

Inside the Select frame are controls used to select the criteria set and 
criteria category to be viewed or printed. The Criteria Set combo box is used to 
select the desired criteria set from a list of all the available criteria sets. 
Once a criteria set is selected the Criteria Category combo box is loaded with 
all of the criteria contained in the set from which one can be selected.

Information for a selected criteria is displayed in the Description text box located in the View frame. Upon selecting the criteria's various rating labels in the Rating frame, any corresponding meaning that may be supplied will appear to the right. The Previous and Next buttons are provided to navigate sequentially through the criteria contained in the set.

Located inside the Print frame are controls used to select and print 
criteria. The option buttons and range boxes are used to indicate the criteria 
to be printed. To print the currently displayed criteria select Current. Select 
All to print all the criteria from the set shown in the Criteria Set combo box. 
A range of criteria from the current set can be printed by selecting the Range 
option and entering the first and last category numbers in the range boxes. When 
valid criteria and print selections have been made the Preview and Print buttons 
are enabled. Use the Preview button to preview the criteria to be printed and 
the Print button to print the report.
