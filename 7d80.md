# Trainer/Supervisor Form: Write Evaluation Tab 
| --- |

The Trainer/Supervisor form Write Evaluation tab is accessed via the 
Trainer/Supervisor - Write Evaluation menu item on the [main form](<7jjr.md>).

The Write Evaluation tab displays a list of trainees/employees for which the current user 
can write an evaluation.&nbsp; This may include all trainees/employees if the current user is assigned to ['Department ALL'](<7mls.md>).&nbsp; An asterisk (\*) denotes that one or more&nbsp; incomplete evaluations exist for the trainee.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria set is shown in the drop 
down selector below the Trainee/Employee list.

To write an evaluation, first select a trainee/employee.&nbsp; This done, the 
default criteria set is automatically entered, any incomplete evaluations are 
displayed, and the Write Evaluation 
button is enabled.&nbsp; The criteria set can be changed at this time, if 
desired, by making another selection from the drop down list.&nbsp; Clicking on 
the Write Evaluation button without selecting an evaluation opens the [Evaluation Writer](<7dbk.md>) with a 
new evaluation.&nbsp; To edit an existing evaluation, first make a selection 
from the Incomplete Evaluations list.&nbsp; The list entries are sequentially 
numbered and are sorted by the 
evaluation end date.&nbsp; Once an evaluation is selected, the criteria set is 
automatically entered and cannot be changed.

Clicking the Close button will 
close this window.
