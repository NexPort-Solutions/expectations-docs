# Write Evaluation

***

The Trainer/Supervisor form Write Evaluation tab is accessed via the Trainer/Supervisor - Write Evaluation menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

The Write Evaluation tab displays a list of trainees/employees for which the current user can write an evaluation.  This may include all trainees/employees if the current user is assigned to ['Department ALL'](7mls.md).  An asterisk (\*) denotes that one or more  incomplete evaluations exist for the trainee.  The evaluation criteria set is shown in the drop down selector below the Trainee/Employee list.

To write an evaluation, first select a trainee/employee.  This done, the default criteria set is automatically entered, any incomplete evaluations are displayed, and the Write Evaluation button is enabled.  The criteria set can be changed at this time, if desired, by making another selection from the drop down list.  Clicking on the Write Evaluation button without selecting an evaluation opens the [Evaluation Writer](7dbk.md) with a new evaluation.  To edit an existing evaluation, first make a selection from the Incomplete Evaluations list.  The list entries are sequentially numbered and are sorted by the evaluation end date.  Once an evaluation is selected, the criteria set is automatically entered and cannot be changed.

Clicking the Close button will close this window.
