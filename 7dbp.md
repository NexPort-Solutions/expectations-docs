# Evaluation Writer: Trainee/Employee Evaluation Tab 
---

**Evaluation Writer Tabs**

The Evaluation Writer appears with the following tabs:

- [Trainee/Employee Information](<7dbk.md>)
- Trainee/Employee Evaluation
- [Reviewer Comments](<7dbq.md>) (when one or more reviewers have deemed an evaluation incomplete)

**Trainee/Employee Evaluation Tab**

This section contains the evaluation for the trainee/employee.&nbsp; Evaluation criteria come from the 
criteria set assigned to the trainee/employee, the criteria set being indicated 
on the 
[Trainee/Employee Information](<7dbk.md>) tab.

The top box displays the Trainee/Employee name of the evaluation, and contains an editable date control.&nbsp; The date control defaults to today's date when creating new evaluations, but may be edited by the Trainer/Supervisor.&nbsp; When re-opening the Evaluation Writer on a particular evaluation (if a subsequent edit is deemed necessary), the date control will default to the last saved evaluation date and continue to be editable.

The bottom box contains the currently selected category.&nbsp; At the top is the category title followed by a description of what is being evaluated.&nbsp; Underneath the description are the ratings.&nbsp; The software supplies nine possible ratings by default, and the list of ratings can be increased, decreased, or modified in several ways for newly-added criteria via the [Ratings sub-tab](<ratings.md>).&nbsp; When writing an evaluation using criteria that were created against the default ratings, the ratings "snapshot" will look like the following:

- 1 - Unacceptable
- 2
- 3
- 4 - Acceptable
- 5
- 6
- 7 - Superior
- Not Observed - The trainee/employee was not observed performing duties 
  related to this category
- Not Responding - The trainee/employee has not displayed adequate improvement despite repeated efforts

Rating meanings for the supplied Unacceptable, Acceptable, and Superior ratings are provided for the default criteria that come with the software.&nbsp; Rating meanings can be supplied for all ratings in the [Add Criteria form](<7gmo.md>), and may be changed in the [Modify Criteria form](<7jhs.md>).&nbsp; Below the ratings is a text box for entering any comments that pertain to this category.&nbsp; To navigate through the categories contained in the criteria set use the buttons located at the bottom left.&nbsp; The navigation buttons perform the following functions:

 - Move to the FIRST category

 - Move to the PREVIOUS category

 - Move to the NEXT category

 - Move to the LAST category

Right of the navigation buttons is a label which displays the number of the 
current category in relation to the total number of categories.&nbsp; Use the 
Goto button to navigate directly to a given category.&nbsp; It opens a window 
that displays a list of all categories for this criteria set.&nbsp; Clicking on 
a category in the window will display that category in the Evaluation Writer.

To spell check the text in the comments box select the Spelling button.

The Save/Quit button brings up the Save Options dialog box.  Selecting the Complete button will save the evaluation as complete.&nbsp; Selecting the Incomplete button will save the evaluation as incomplete.&nbsp; Selecting the Discard Evaluation button will delete the incomplete evaluation.&nbsp; Selecting the Discard Changes button will exit a new or incomplete evaluation without saving changes.&nbsp; The Cancel button will return to the evaluation without saving it.&nbsp; If the evaluation is saved as complete **further changes will not be allowed**.&nbsp; 
If the evaluation is saved as incomplete the trainer/supervisor may return to it 
at a later time to complete the evaluation.
