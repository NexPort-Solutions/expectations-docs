# Evaluation Writer: Reviewer Comments Tab

***

**Evaluation Writer Tabs**

The Evaluation Writer appears with the following tabs:

* [Trainee/Employee Information](7dbk.md)
* [Trainee/Employee Evaluation](7dbp.md)
* Reviewer Comments

**Reviewer Comments Tab**

On this tab, comments entered by a reviewer are seen.  Reviewer comments appear in the writer only when editing an evaluation that has been disapproved by one or more assigned reviewers.

## | NOTE: Until all reviewers have approved the evaluation, or unless turned off in the [Unapproved Evaluations](unapprove.htm) configuration sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, DRAFT will appear across each page of the report when printing or previewing. |
