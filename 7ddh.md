# Evaluation Viewer: Trainee/Employee Evaluation Tab 
-----

**Evaluation Viewer Tabs**

The Evaluation Viewer appears with the following tabs:

- [Trainee/Employee Information](<7ddc.md>)
- Trainee/Employee Evaluation
- [Reviewer Comments](<7ddr.md>)
- [Signatures](<evlvwsig.md>)

**<font size="4">Trainee/Employee Evaluation Tab</font>**

This tab contains the individual criteria used to grade the trainee/employee, 
together with their associated ratings and comments.&nbsp;  Evaluation criteria come from the Criteria Set assigned to the trainee/employee. (See 
[Trainee/Employee Information Tab](<7ddc.md>).)

The top box displays the trainee/employee name and the date of the evaluation.

The bottom box defines the evaluation category.&nbsp; The title of the category appears at the top of the box.&nbsp; Below the title is the category definition.&nbsp; The software supplies nine possible ratings by default, and the list of ratings can be increased, decreased, or modified in several ways for newly-added criteria via the [Ratings sub-tab](<ratings.md>).&nbsp; For evaluations which use criteria that were created against the default ratings, the ratings "snapshot" for those evaluations will look like the following:

- 1 - Unacceptable
- 2
- 3
- 4 - Acceptable
- 5
- 6
- 7 - Superior
- Not Observed - The trainee/employee was not observed performing duties related to this category
- Not Responding - The trainee/employee has not displayed adequate improvement despite repeated efforts

Rating meanings for the supplied Unacceptable, Acceptable, and Superior ratings are provided for the default criteria that come with the software.&nbsp; Rating meanings can be supplied for all ratings in the [Add Criteria form](<7gmo.md>), and may be changed in the [Modify Criteria form](<7jhs.md>).&nbsp; Below the rating section are any comments pertaining to this category.&nbsp; To navigate through the categories contained in the criteria set use the buttons located at the bottom left.&nbsp; The navigation buttons perform the following functions:

 - Move to the FIRST category

 - Move to the PREVIOUS category

 - Move to the NEXT category

 - Move to the LAST category

Right of the navigation buttons is a label which displays the number of the 
current category in relation to the total number of categories.&nbsp; Use the 
Goto button to navigate directly to a given category.&nbsp; It opens a window 
that displays a list of all categories for this criteria set.&nbsp; Clicking on 
a category in the window will display that category in the Evaluation Viewer.

The Quit button closes the window.
