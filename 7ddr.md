# Evaluation Viewer: Reviewer Comments Tab

***

**Evaluation Viewer Tabs**

The Evaluation Viewer appears with the following tabs:

* [Trainee/Employee Information](7ddc.md)
* [Trainee/Employee Evaluation](7ddh.md)
* Reviewer Comments
* [Signatures](evlvwsig.md)

**Reviewer Comments Tab**

On this tab, comments entered by a reviewer are seen.  Reviewer comments appear in the viewer only when viewing an evaluation that has been authored by a trainer/supervisor with one or more assigned reviewers.

## | NOTE: Until all reviewers have approved the evaluation, or unless turned off in the [Unapproved Evaluations](unapprove.htm) configuration sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, DRAFT will appear across each page of the report when printing or previewing. |
