# Administrator Form:  Trainer/Supervisor Tab 
-----

Selecting either the Administrator - Create Trainer/Supervisor Signature Key 
menu item or the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Trainer/Supervisor menu item on the 
[main form](<7jjr.md>) brings up the 
Trainer/Supervisor tab on the [Administrator form](<7df4.md>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Trainer/Supervisor tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to 
manage the trainer/supervisor accounts.&nbsp; It is accessible only on a
[central system](<7mls.md>).&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of 
trainers/supervisors appears at the left of the tab.&nbsp; Use the buttons to 
the right of the list to create a signature key or to add, modify or delete a 
trainer/supervisor account.&nbsp; Selecting the Close button exits the form. 

## Create Signature Key Button

The Create Signature Key button is not enabled until after a 
trainer/supervisor is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to create a 
signature key for the selected trainer/supervisor.&nbsp; Selecting the button 
opens a browse for folder window which is used to select the location where the 
signature key is to be created.&nbsp; Note: the folder browser will not appear in the case where the "Disable browsing for Signatures folder" option is checked in the [Signatures](<sig.md>) sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, and instead the signature key will be created in the "Default Signatures folder" (also configurable in the sub-tab).&nbsp; To create the key in the specified folder 
select the OK button.&nbsp; Keys can be stored together on the local PC or 
externally on a memory stick and given to the individual.&nbsp; The key is then 
used to electronically sign an evaluation, which is accomplished on the [Evaluation Viewer 
Signatures tab](<evlvwsig.md>).&nbsp; Note that a previously created key for an individual 
will be invalidated and that only the last key created can be used to sign an 
evaluation.

## Add Trainer/Supervisor Button

The Add Trainer/Supervisor button is enabled at all times.&nbsp; It is used 
to add a new trainer/supervisor account.&nbsp; Selecting the button opens the [Add Trainer/Supervisor 
form](<7gj4.md>).

## Modify Trainer/Supervisor Button

The Modify Trainer/Supervisor button is not enabled until after a 
trainer/supervisor is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to edit an 
existing trainer/supervisor account.&nbsp; Selecting the button opens the
[Modify Trainer/Supervisor form](<7je8.md>).

## Delete Trainer/Supervisor Button

The Delete Trainer/Supervisor button is not enabled until after a 
trainer/supervisor is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to delete an 
existing trainer/supervisor account.&nbsp; Selecting it opens a dialog window 
with Yes and No buttons and a prompt indicating the trainer/supervisor account 
which is to be deleted.&nbsp; The selected trainer/supervisor account, along with any [Training & Development](<traindev.md>) application records associated with that account, are deleted upon selection of the Yes button.

> **NOTE** : Trainers/supervisors that have written evaluations cannot be deleted.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>All Training &amp; Development records associated with a particular trainer/supervisor will be deleted upon deletion of that trainer/supervisor's account.</b></font>&nbsp; Additionally, a trainer/supervisor cannot delete their own account.
