# Administrator Screen: Trainees/Employees Tab

***

Selecting either the Administrator - Create Trainee/Employee Signature Key menu item or the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Trainee/Employee menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md) brings up the Trainee/Employee tab on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).

&#x20;         &#x20;

The Trainee/Employee tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to manage the trainee/employee accounts.  It is accessible only on a [central system](7mls.md).   A list of trainees/employees appears at the left of the tab.  Use the buttons to the right of the list to create a signature key or to add, modify or delete a trainee/employee account.  Selecting the Close button exits the form.

## Create Signature Key Button

The Create Signature Key button is not enabled until after a trainee/employee is selected from the list.  It is used to create a signature key for the selected trainee/employee.  Selecting the button opens a browse for folder window which is used to select the location where the signature key is to be created.  Note: the folder browser will not appear in the case where the "Disable browsing for Signatures folder" option is checked in the [Signatures](sig.md) sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, and instead the signature key will be created in the "Default Signatures folder" (also configurable in the sub-tab).  To create the key in the specified folder select the OK button.  Keys can be stored together on the local PC or externally on a memory stick and given to the individual.  The key is then used to electronically sign an evaluation, which is accomplished on the [Evaluation Viewer Signatures tab](evlvwsig.md).  Note that a previously created key for an individual will be invalidated and that only the last key created can be used to sign an evaluation.

## Add Trainee/Employee Button

The Add Trainee/Employee button is enabled at all times.  It is used to add a new trainee/employee account.  Selecting the button opens the [Add Trainee/Employee form](7gkw.md).

## Modify Trainee/Employee Button

The Modify Trainee/Employee button is not enabled until after a trainee/employee is selected from the list.  It is used to edit an existing trainee/employee account.  Selecting the button opens the [Modify Trainee/Employee form](7jg0.md).

## Delete Trainee/Employee Button

The Delete Trainee/Employee button is not enabled until after a trainee/employee is selected from the list.  It is used to delete an existing trainee/employee account.  Selecting it opens a dialog window with Yes and No buttons and a prompt indicating the trainee/employee account which is to be deleted.  The selected trainee/employee account, along with any evaluations and [Training & Development](traindev.md) application records associated with that account, are deleted upon selection of the Yes button.

> **NOTE** : When a trainee/employee account is deleted, all associated evaluations and Training & Development records will be deleted upon deletion of that trainee/employee's account.
