# Administrator Form:  Trainee/Employee Tab 
---

Selecting either the Administrator - Create Trainee/Employee Signature Key 
menu item or the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Trainee/Employee menu item 
on the [main form](<7jjr.md>) brings up the Trainee/Employee tab 
on the [Administrator form](<7df4.md>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Trainee/Employee tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to 
manage the trainee/employee accounts.&nbsp; It is accessible only on a
[central system](<7mls.md>).&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of 
trainees/employees appears at the left of the tab.&nbsp; Use the buttons to the 
right of the list to create a signature key or to add, modify or delete a 
trainee/employee account.&nbsp; Selecting the Close button exits the form. 

## Create Signature Key Button

The Create Signature Key button is not enabled until after a trainee/employee 
is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to create a signature key for the 
selected trainee/employee.&nbsp; Selecting the button opens a browse for folder 
window which is used to select the location where the signature key is to be 
created.&nbsp; Note: the folder browser will not appear in the case where the "Disable browsing for Signatures folder" option is checked in the [Signatures](<sig.md>) sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, and instead the signature key will be created in the "Default Signatures folder" (also configurable in the sub-tab).&nbsp; To create the key in the specified folder select the OK button.&nbsp; 
Keys can be stored together on the local PC or externally on a memory stick and 
given to the individual.&nbsp; The key is then used to electronically sign an 
evaluation, which is accomplished on the [Evaluation Viewer 
Signatures tab](<evlvwsig.md>).&nbsp; Note that a previously created key for an individual 
will be invalidated and that only the last key created can be used to sign an 
evaluation.

## Add Trainee/Employee Button

The Add Trainee/Employee button is enabled at all times.&nbsp; It is used to 
add a new trainee/employee account.&nbsp; Selecting the button opens the [Add Trainee/Employee form](<7gkw.md>).

## Modify Trainee/Employee Button

The Modify Trainee/Employee button is not enabled until after a 
trainee/employee is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to edit an existing 
trainee/employee account.&nbsp; Selecting the button opens the [Modify Trainee/Employee form](<7jg0.md>).

## Delete Trainee/Employee Button

The Delete Trainee/Employee button is not enabled until after a trainee/employee is selected from the list.&nbsp; It is used to delete an existing trainee/employee account.&nbsp; Selecting it opens a dialog window with Yes and No buttons and a prompt indicating the trainee/employee account which is to be deleted.&nbsp; The selected trainee/employee account, along with any evaluations and [Training & Development](<traindev.md>) application records associated with that account, are deleted upon selection of the Yes button.
