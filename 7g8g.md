# Administrator Form:  Criteria Tab 
| --- |

Selecting the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Criteria menu item on the
[main form](<7jjr.md>) brings up the Criteria tab on the
[Administrator form](<7df4.md>).

The Criteria tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to manage 
the database of authored criteria.&nbsp; It is accessible only on a
[central system](<7mls.md>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Listed on the tab are all the criteria in the database.&nbsp; 
To the right of the list of criteria are four buttons, the top three of which 
invoke the data management functions.&nbsp; The data management buttons allow new 
criteria to be added to the database or existing criteria to be modified or 
deleted.&nbsp; Selecting the Close button exits the form.

To add a criterion, select the Add Criteria button.&nbsp; This brings up the
[Add Criteria form](<7gmo.md>).&nbsp; Selecting a criterion in the list 
then clicking on the Modify Criteria button loads the selected criterion into 
the [Modify Criteria form](<7jhs.md>).&nbsp; To delete a criterion, 
again select it in the list then click on the Delete Criteria button.&nbsp; A 
confirmation dialog box is displayed giving the user the opportunity to abort.&nbsp; 
Upon confirmation the selected criterion is deleted from the database.
