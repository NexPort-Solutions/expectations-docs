# Administrator Screen: Criteria Tab

***

Selecting the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Criteria menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md) brings up the Criteria tab on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).

The Criteria tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to manage the database of authored criteria.  It is accessible only on a [central system](7mls.md).   Listed on the tab are all the criteria in the database.  To the right of the list of criteria are four buttons, the top three of which invoke the data management functions.  The data management buttons allow new criteria to be added to the database or existing criteria to be modified or deleted.  Selecting the Close button exits the form.

To add a criterion, select the Add Criteria button.  This brings up the [Add Criteria form](7gmo.md).  Selecting a criterion in the list then clicking on the Modify Criteria button loads the selected criterion into the [Modify Criteria form](7jhs.md).  To delete a criterion, again select it in the list then click on the Delete Criteria button.  A confirmation dialog box is displayed giving the user the opportunity to abort.  Upon confirmation the selected criterion is deleted from the database.
