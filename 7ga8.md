# Administrator Screen: Criteria Sets Tab

***

Selecting the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Criteria Set menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md) brings up the Criteria Sets tab on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).

The Criteria Set tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to manage the database of authored criteria sets.  It is accessible only on a [central system](7mls.md).   Listed on the tab are all the criteria sets in the database.  To the right of the list of criteria sets are four buttons, the top three of which invoke the data management functions.  The data management buttons allow new criteria sets to be added to the database or existing criteria sets to be modified or deleted.  Selecting the Close button exits the form.

To add a criteria set, select the Add Criteria Set button.  This brings up the [Add Criteria Set form](7jcg.md).  Selecting a criteria set in the list then clicking on the Modify Criteria Set button loads the selected criteria set into the [Modify Criteria Set form](7jjk.md).  To delete a criteria set, again select it in the list then click on the Delete Criteria Set button.  A confirmation dialog box is displayed giving the user the opportunity to abort.  Upon confirmation the selected criteria set is deleted from the database.

One or more criteria sets may be hidden from most "criteria set"-related controls throughout the forms in Expectations by means of checking checkboxes next to criteria set names, and then clicking the "Hide" button.  Hidden criteria sets may be shown again (if desired) by checking the checkbox next to each red criteria set and clicking the "Show" button.
