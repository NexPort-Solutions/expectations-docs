# Administrator Form:  Criteria Sets     Tab 
| --- |

Selecting the Administrator - Add/Modify/Delete A Criteria Set menu item on 
the [main form](<7jjr.md>) brings up the Criteria Sets tab on the
[Administrator form](<7df4.md>).

The Criteria Set tab on the Administrator form allows a level 3 user to 
manage the database of authored criteria sets.&nbsp; It is accessible only on a
[central system](<7mls.md>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Listed on the tab are all the 
criteria sets in the database.&nbsp; To the right of the list of criteria sets are 
four buttons, the top three of which invoke the data management functions.&nbsp; The 
data management buttons allow new criteria sets to be added to the database or 
existing criteria sets to be modified or deleted.&nbsp; Selecting the Close button 
exits the form.

To add a criteria set, select the Add Criteria Set button.&nbsp; This brings up 
the [Add Criteria Set form](<7jcg.md>).&nbsp; Selecting a criteria set in the list then clicking 
on the Modify Criteria Set button loads the selected criteria set into the
[Modify Criteria Set form](<7jjk.md>).&nbsp; To delete a criteria set, 
again select it in the list then click on the Delete Criteria Set button.&nbsp; A 
confirmation dialog box is displayed giving the user the opportunity to abort.&nbsp; 
Upon confirmation the selected criteria set is deleted from the database.

One or more criteria sets may be hidden from most "criteria set"-related controls throughout the forms in Expectations by means of checking checkboxes next to criteria set names, and then clicking the "Hide" button.&nbsp; Hidden criteria sets may be shown again (if desired) by checking the checkbox next to each red criteria set and clicking the "Show" button.
