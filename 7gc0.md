# Trainer/Supervisor Roster

***

The Trainer/Supervisor Roster displays a list of all trainers/supervisors in the system.  Each trainer's/supervisor's Name, ID and Department are displayed.  If a trainer/supervisor is active the text will be black.  An inactive trainer/supervisor is denoted by red text.

Use the three buttons at the top left of the form to display either all trainers/supervisors, active only or inactive only.  The print button will send a formatted report to the default printer based on what trainers/supervisors are currently being displayed.
