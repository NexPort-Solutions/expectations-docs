# Trainee/Employee Reports 
-----

The **Trainee/Employee Reports** form is used to select the evaluations 
that are displayed on the [Trainees/Employees 
Charts](<7mi8.md>) window.&nbsp; Note that a level 1 trainer/supervisor is only allowed 
to select and view their own evaluations.&nbsp; Evaluations shown in the chart are 
ordered by the end date of the evaluation period.&nbsp; The **Trainee/Employee Reports** form includes the following labeled controls:

- **Trainee/Employee (required selection):** A drop down list showing 
active trainees/employees, by last name then first and sorted 
alphabetically.&nbsp; Select the trainee/employee from the list whose evaluations 
are to be used in the chart.
- **Trainer/Supervisor:** A drop down list showing active 
trainers/supervisors who have authored evaluations, by last name then first 
and sorted alphabetically.&nbsp; The list is generated after a 
trainee/employee has been chosen.&nbsp; Select the trainer/supervisor whose evaluations 
are to be used in the chart.&nbsp; If no selection is made, then all evaluations for 
  indicated trainee/employee are used.
- **Range:**Option buttons used to further screen the evaluations.
    - **All DOR's (default selection):** No further screening is performed.&nbsp; 
All evaluations for the indicated trainee/employee and, if applicable, 
trainer/supervisor are selected for the chart.
    - **Evaluation #:** Further screen the evaluations by sequence number.&nbsp; 
This is the order they would appear with **All DOR's** selected.&nbsp; 
The total number of evaluations is displayed at the far right.&nbsp; Start 
and end evaluation numbers are initially defaulted to those of the first and 
last evaluation.
    - **Date:** Further screens the evaluations by the end date of the 
evaluation period.&nbsp; The two date picker controls are used to specify 
the window of inclusion.&nbsp; They are initially defaulted to the dates of 
the first and last evaluation which would be returned with **All DOR's** 
selected.
    - **Criteria Set:** Further screens the evaluations by criteria set.&nbsp; 
The drop down list shows the criteria sets from evaluations that would be 
returned with **All DOR's** selected.
    - **Comments Include:** Further screens the evaluations by comments.&nbsp; This 
range selection searches all of the comments fields of evaluations and their criteria 
choice selections, as well as reviewer and signature comments, for up to 255 characters 
of individual term or exact-phrase texts.&nbsp; Commas and/or spaces may be used when 
supplying more than one individual term in the text field.&nbsp; One exact phrase 
surrounded by double quotes may be supplied instead of individual terms.
- **View:** This button is enabled after a trainee/employee selection 
has been made.&nbsp; It opens the [Trainees/Employees 
Charts](<7mi8.md>) window, which is then loaded with evaluations that meet the 
specified criteria.
- **Close:** Selecting this button closes the **Trainee/Employee Reports** window.
