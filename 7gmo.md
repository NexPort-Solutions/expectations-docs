#     Add Criteria Form 
---

The Add Criteria form is accessed from the [Criteria tab](<7g8g.md>) on the [Administrator form](<7df4.md>).&nbsp; It allows new criteria to be entered into the Expectations database.&nbsp; The Category and Description text boxes must be filled in, and you may supply Meanings in the corresponding text box by first individually selecting the Labels of the criteria's Ratings.&nbsp; Check or uncheck the box next to a rating's label to specify whether or not a comment will be required (see [Forced Comments](<7crq.md>)) when selecting the rating in the Evaluation Writer.&nbsp; To save changes click the Accept Criteria button.&nbsp; A blank field will result in an error dialog.&nbsp; Attempting to exit the form without saving changes will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another opportunity to save.

Selecting the Spell Check button checks the text in each of the fields for 
spelling.&nbsp; To view an example criterion select the Show Example button.
