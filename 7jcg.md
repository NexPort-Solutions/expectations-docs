# Add a Criteria Set

***

The Add Criteria Set form is accessed from the [Criteria Sets tab](7ga8.md) on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).  It allows new criteria sets to be entered into the Expectations database.  A Criteria Set Name must be entered and criteria added to the set using the arrow buttons.  A criteria set can include up to 50 criteria.  To save changes click the Submit button.  An empty name field or an empty set will result in an error dialog.  Attempting to exit the form without saving changes will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another opportunity to save.

The Add Criteria Set form arrow buttons perform the following functions:

> * Moves selected criteria up the Criteria Set list.
> * Adds all (up to 50) criteria to the Criteria Set list.
> * Adds selected criteria to the Criteria Set list.
> *
>
> Removes selected criteria from the Criteria Set list.
