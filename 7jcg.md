# Add Criteria Set Form
-----

The Add Criteria Set form is accessed from the [Criteria Sets tab](<7ga8.md>) on the [Administrator form](<7df4.md>).&nbsp; It 
allows new criteria sets to be entered into the Expectations database.&nbsp; A 
Criteria Set Name must be entered and criteria added to the set using the 
arrow buttons.&nbsp; A criteria set can include up to 50 
criteria.&nbsp; To save 
changes click the Submit button.&nbsp; An empty name field or an empty set will 
result in an error dialog.&nbsp; Attempting to exit the form without saving changes 
will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another opportunity to 
save.
