# Modify Trainer/Supervisor

***

The Modify Trainer/Supervisor form is accessed from the [Trainer/Supervisor tab](7dgw.md) on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).  It allows the information for a trainer/supervisor to be modified.  Each field is filled with the current information for the selected trainer/supervisor.  All fields except for "Email Address" must be filled in.  To save changes click the Submit button.  A blank field will result in an error dialog.  Attempting to exit the form without saving changes will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another opportunity to save.
