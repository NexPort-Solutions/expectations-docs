# Modify Trainee/Employee     Form 
-----

The Modify Trainee/Employee form is accessed from the [Trainee/Employee tab](<7g6o.md>) on the [Administrator form](<7df4.md>).&nbsp; 
It allows the information for a trainee/employee to be modified.&nbsp; Each field is 
filled with the current information for the selected trainee/employee.&nbsp; All fields must be filled in, aside from [special considerations](<emailbuslog.md>) for the optional "Trainer/Supervisor Email Notifications" section.&nbsp; To save changes click the Submit button.&nbsp; A blank field will result in an error dialog.&nbsp; Attempting to exit the form without 
saving changes will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another 
opportunity to save.
