# Modify Criteria

***

The Modify Criteria form is accessed from the [Criteria tab](7g8g.md) on the [Administrator form](7df4.md).  It allows changes to be made to existing criteria.  Information for the selected criterion is loaded into the form.  The Category and Description text boxes must be filled in, and you may supply Meanings in the corresponding text box by first individually selecting the Labels of the criteria's Ratings. Check or uncheck the box next to a rating's label to specify whether or not a comment will be required (see [Forced Comments](7crq.md)) when selecting the rating in the Evaluation Writer.  To save changes click the Accept Criteria button.  A blank field will result in an error dialog.  Attempting to exit the form without saving changes will bring up a confirmation dialog, giving the user another opportunity to save.

Selecting the Spell Check button checks the text in each of the fields for spelling.  To view an example criterion select the Show Example button.

The Modify Criteria form includes the following fields:

* **Category** (criterion title)
* **Description** (what is being rated)
* **Rating** (consists of the rating labels and meanings)
* **Labels** (rating label texts and [Forced Comment](7crq.md)-mirroring checkboxes for the current criterion)
* **Meaning** (description of currently selected rating label, if available)

> **NOTE** : After editing the ratings themselves ([Ratings](ratings.md) sub-tab of [Global Settings](globset.md)), any existing criteria which should have the updated ratings must be deleted and recreated via the [Add Criteria](7gmo.md) form to get the new list of ratings.  Recreated criteria will need to have rating meanings re-added, and the criteria will also need to be re-added to any prior criteria sets using the [Modify Criteria Set](7jjk.md) form.
