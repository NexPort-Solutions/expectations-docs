# Startup

***

To start Expectations select the shortcut on the desktop or in the Start menu. When the [main form](7jjr.md) first appears the splash screen is displayed. Clicking on the splash screen will make it go away.

As Expectations starts up it attempts to establish a database connection. If successful, the [Login form](7d2o.md) appears after the splash screen goes away. If Expectations is unable to establish a database connection, use the File - Open Database menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md) to manually establish a connection. Once the connection is made to the database the [Login form](7d2o.md) will appear.
