# Startup
-----

To start Expectations select the shortcut on the 
desktop or in the Start menu.&nbsp; When the [main form](<7jjr.md>) 
first appears the splash screen is displayed.&nbsp; Clicking on the splash screen will make it go away.

As Expectations starts up it attempts to establish a database connection.&nbsp; 
If successful, the [Login form](<7d2o.md>) appears after the 
splash screen goes away.&nbsp; If Expectations is unable to establish a database 
connection, use the File - Open Database menu item on the [main form](<7jjr.md>) to manually establish a connection.&nbsp; Once the connection is made 
to the database the [Login form](<7d2o.md>) will appear.

> **NOTE** : For instructions on <br>    manually making a database connection, see the section entitled<br>    [Database Connection](<7mnk.md>).
