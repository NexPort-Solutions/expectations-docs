# Trainer/Supervisor Chart Screen 
---

This screen depicts, in chart format, all the evaluations that meet the criteria selected.

The top line displays the Trainer/Supervisor Name and ID number.&nbsp; The label section, below the title line, defines the data columns.&nbsp; The data section follows the label section and shows the data in a tabular format.&nbsp; The first column, labeled Eval #, is simply a sequence number that indicates the position the evaluation appears in the list of total evaluations.&nbsp; The second column is the date the evaluation was completed.&nbsp; The third column is the name of the Trainee/Employee whom the evaluation was written on.&nbsp; The next fifty columns show the rating for a particular criteria.&nbsp; The rating abbreviation is displayed and color-coded for easier interpretation, and both may be changed for newly-added criteria via the [Ratings sub-tab](<ratings.md>).&nbsp; The legend texts and colors supplied by default in the software for ratings is as follows:

RED = 1-3

GREEN = 4-7

YELLOW = Not Observed

BLACK = Not Responding

Each screen will show 10 records, and the legend items will be updated for the 10 evaluations currently in view.&nbsp; The Next and Previous buttons will be used to move forward and backward through screens showing more records.&nbsp; If the record set selected has less than ten records, the Next and Previous buttons will remain inactive.&nbsp; The 'Include Legend in Report' checkbox is checked by default and, when checked, allows for laying out all legend texts and colors of a particular chart query prior to laying out the chart report.

The Print Color button will print the chart in full color.&nbsp; Use the Preview Color button to preview the report.&nbsp; Within the preview utility, the report can be printed or exported.

The Print B & W button will print the chart with all colors converted to their corresponding grayscale value.&nbsp; Use the Preview B & W button to preview the report.&nbsp; Within the preview utility the report can be printed or exported.
