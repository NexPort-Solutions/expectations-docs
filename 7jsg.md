# Trainer/Supervisor Chart Screen

***

This screen depicts, in chart format, all the evaluations that meet the criteria selected.

The top line displays the Trainer/Supervisor Name and ID number.  The label section, below the title line, defines the data columns.  The data section follows the label section and shows the data in a tabular format.  The first column, labeled Eval #, is simply a sequence number that indicates the position the evaluation appears in the list of total evaluations.  The second column is the date the evaluation was completed.  The third column is the name of the Trainee/Employee whom the evaluation was written on.  The next fifty columns show the rating for a particular criteria.  The rating abbreviation is displayed and color-coded for easier interpretation, and both may be changed for newly-added criteria via the [Ratings sub-tab](ratings.md).  The legend texts and colors supplied by default in the software for ratings is as follows:

RED = 1-3

GREEN = 4-7

YELLOW = Not Observed

BLACK = Not Responding

Each screen will show 10 records, and the legend items will be updated for the 10 evaluations currently in view.  The Next and Previous buttons will be used to move forward and backward through screens showing more records.  If the record set selected has less than ten records, the Next and Previous buttons will remain inactive.  The 'Include Legend in Report' checkbox is checked by default and, when checked, allows for laying out all legend texts and colors of a particular chart query prior to laying out the chart report.

The Print Color button will print the chart in full color.  Use the Preview Color button to preview the report.  Within the preview utility, the report can be printed or exported.

The Print B & W button will print the chart with all colors converted to their corresponding grayscale value.  Use the Preview B & W button to preview the report.  Within the preview utility the report can be printed or exported.
