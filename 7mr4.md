# Download Form 
-----

The Download form allows information entered at one workstation to be saved 
to an external file for the purpose of transferring to another workstation.&nbsp; 
It provides users that do not have network access the ability to maintain a
[centralized database](<7mnk.md>).&nbsp; To bring up the 
Download form select the Administrator - Download menu item on the
[main form](<7jjr.md>).

Each of the tabs on the Download form is a utility 
that exports a different segment of the Expectations database.&nbsp; One or more of 
the tabs on the form may be disabled depending on the [system type](<7mls.md>) and the user's [security level](<7je8.md>).&nbsp; 
&nbsp; The tabs are labeled as follows:

- [Trainers/Supervisors](<7msw.md>)
- [Trainees/Employees](<7muo.md>)
- [Evaluations by Trainer/Supervisor](<7mwg.md>)
- [Evaluations by Trainee/Employee](<7my8.md>)
- [Criteria Sets](<7myd.md>)
- [System Tables](<7mye.md>)

| <font size="3"><b>NOTE</b>: </font><font color="#FF0000">Only those downloaded Zip files from a source database which is configured by the same Expectations version as the destination database are supported in the upload process.</font>&nbsp; The source and destination databases may be either of the two database types in any combination of MS Access or SQL Server. |
