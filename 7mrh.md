# Global Settings Tab: Report Header     Sub-Tab 
---

The Report Header sub-tab of the [Global Settings Tab](<globset.md>) 
is accessed via the Administrator - Report Header menu item on the
[main form](<7jjr.md>).

The Report Header sub-tab is where the organization title is entered.&nbsp; It 
appears at the top of the printed evaluation reports and worksheets.&nbsp; To 
achieve spacing between the header and evaluation, enter additional line feeds 
after the text.&nbsp; Changes are saved by selecting the Save button.&nbsp; If a 
header is not desired then leave the Organization box blank.&nbsp; A user
[security level](<7gj4.md>) of 3 is required in order to change 
the text.
