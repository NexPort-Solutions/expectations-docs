# Report Header

***

The Report Header sub-tab of the [Global Settings Tab](globset.md) is accessed via the Administrator - Report Header menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

The Report Header sub-tab is where the organization title is entered.  It appears at the top of the printed evaluation reports and worksheets.  To achieve spacing between the header and evaluation, enter additional line feeds after the text.  Changes are saved by selecting the Save button.  If a header is not desired then leave the Organization box blank.  A user [security level](7gj4.md) of 3 is required in order to change the text.
