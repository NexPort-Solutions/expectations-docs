# Download Form: Evaluations by Trainer/Supervisor Tab 
| --- |

Use the download evaluations by trainer/supervisor tab on the [download form](<7mr4.md>) to transfer evaluations written by a specified trainer/supervisor from the configured database (central or local) to the current workstation.&nbsp; The Active and Inactive radio buttons filter out unwanted selections from the drop down list.&nbsp; Checking the "Include incomplete evaluations" checkbox will reset the drop down list to also include those trainers/supervisors which may have only saved 'Incomplete' evaluations, and 'Incomplete' evaluations of a trainer/supervisor will also appear alongside any evaluations they had previously saved as 'Complete' in the "Select Evaluations" list.

Begin by selecting the trainer/supervisor in the drop down list.&nbsp; Evaluations written by the selected trainer/supervisor are then displayed in the list box underneath, listed by date and the trainee/employee for whom they were written.&nbsp; The All Trainers/Supervisors selection displays the evaluations for all the trainers/supervisors shown in the drop down list.&nbsp; Next select the evaluations to download from those shown in the list.&nbsp; Multiple selections can be made using the Ctrl and Shift keys.&nbsp; Evaluations to be downloaded are shown highlighted.&nbsp; Click on a selected evaluation to deselect.

Clicking the Download button brings up a Save As window.&nbsp; Use the Save As 
window to browse to the location where the evaluations are to be saved then 
enter the file name to save them in.&nbsp; Selecting the Save button will start the 
download.&nbsp; The Cancel button aborts the download.

While the download is in progress, a progress bars appears below the list box 
on the Download form.&nbsp; Use the Close button or the control box X to close the 
form.&nbsp; Attempting to close the form while a download is in progress will bring 
up a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort the download.

| **NOTE:** &nbsp;Evaluations may be downloaded by any user on a [Stand-Alone System](<7mls.md>)&nbsp; <br>or by [security level](<7je8.md>) 3 users on a<br>[Central System](<7mls.md>). |
