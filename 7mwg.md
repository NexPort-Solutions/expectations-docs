# Download Screen: Evaluations by Trainer/Supervisor Tab

***

Use the download evaluations by trainer/supervisor tab on the [download form](7mr4.md) to transfer evaluations written by a specified trainer/supervisor from the configured database (central or local) to the current workstation.  The Active and Inactive radio buttons filter out unwanted selections from the drop down list.  Checking the "Include incomplete evaluations" checkbox will reset the drop down list to also include those trainers/supervisors which may have only saved 'Incomplete' evaluations, and 'Incomplete' evaluations of a trainer/supervisor will also appear alongside any evaluations they had previously saved as 'Complete' in the "Select Evaluations" list.

Begin by selecting the trainer/supervisor in the drop down list.  Evaluations written by the selected trainer/supervisor are then displayed in the list box underneath, listed by date and the trainee/employee for whom they were written.  The All Trainers/Supervisors selection displays the evaluations for all the trainers/supervisors shown in the drop down list.  Next select the evaluations to download from those shown in the list.  Multiple selections can be made using the Ctrl and Shift keys.  Evaluations to be downloaded are shown highlighted.  Click on a selected evaluation to deselect.

Clicking the Download button brings up a Save As window.  Use the Save As window to browse to the location where the evaluations are to be saved then enter the file name to save them in.  Selecting the Save button will start the download.  The Cancel button aborts the download.

While the download is in progress, a progress bars appears below the list box on the Download form.  Use the Close button or the control box X to close the form.  Attempting to close the form while a download is in progress will bring up a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort the download.
