# Download Form: Evaluations by     Trainee/Employee Tab 
---

Use the download evaluations by trainee/employee tab on the [download form](<7mr4.md>) to transfer evaluations written for a specified trainee/employee from the configured database (central or local) to the current workstation.&nbsp; The Active and Inactive radio buttons filter out unwanted selections from the drop down list.&nbsp; Checking the "Include incomplete evaluations" checkbox will reset the drop down list to also include those trainees/employees which may only have 'Incomplete' evaluations saved for them, and 'Incomplete' evaluations for a trainee/employee will also appear alongside any evaluations which were previously saved for them as 'Complete' in the "Select Evaluations" list.

Begin by selecting the trainee/employee in the drop down list.&nbsp; Evaluations written for the selected trainee/employee are then displayed in the list box underneath, listed by date and the trainer/supervisor by whom they were written.&nbsp; The All Trainees/Employees selection displays the evaluations for all the trainees/employees shown in the drop down list.&nbsp; Next select the evaluations to download from those shown in the list.&nbsp; Multiple selections can be made using the Ctrl and Shift keys.&nbsp; Evaluations to be downloaded are shown highlighted.&nbsp; Click on a selected evaluation to deselect.

Clicking the Download button brings up a Save As window.&nbsp; Use the Save 
As window to browse to the location where the evaluations are 
to be saved then enter the file name to save them in.&nbsp; Selecting the Save 
button will start the download.&nbsp; The Cancel button aborts the download.

While the download is in progress, a progress bars appears below the list box 
on the Download form.&nbsp; Use the Close button or the control box X to close 
the form.&nbsp; Attempting to close the form while a download is in progress 
will bring up a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort the 
download.

| **NOTE:** Evaluations may be downloaded by any user on a [Stand-Alone System](<7mls.md>)&nbsp; 
or by [security level](<7je8.md>) 3 users on a
[Central System](<7mls.md>). |
