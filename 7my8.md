# Download Screen: Evaluations by Trainee/Employee Tab

***

Use the download evaluations by trainee/employee tab on the [download form](broken-reference) to transfer evaluations written for a specified trainee/employee from the configured database (central or local) to the current workstation.  The Active and Inactive radio buttons filter out unwanted selections from the drop down list.  Checking the "Include incomplete evaluations" checkbox will reset the drop down list to also include those trainees/employees which may only have 'Incomplete' evaluations saved for them, and 'Incomplete' evaluations for a trainee/employee will also appear alongside any evaluations which were previously saved for them as 'Complete' in the "Select Evaluations" list.

Begin by selecting the trainee/employee in the drop down list.  Evaluations written for the selected trainee/employee are then displayed in the list box underneath, listed by date and the trainer/supervisor by whom they were written.  The All Trainees/Employees selection displays the evaluations for all the trainees/employees shown in the drop down list.  Next select the evaluations to download from those shown in the list.  Multiple selections can be made using the Ctrl and Shift keys.  Evaluations to be downloaded are shown highlighted.  Click on a selected evaluation to deselect.

Clicking the Download button brings up a Save As window.  Use the Save As window to browse to the location where the evaluations are to be saved then enter the file name to save them in.  Selecting the Save button will start the download.  The Cancel button aborts the download.

While the download is in progress, a progress bars appears below the list box on the Download form.  Use the Close button or the control box X to close the form.  Attempting to close the form while a download is in progress will bring up a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort the download.

## | **NOTE:** Evaluations may be downloaded by any user on a [Stand-Alone System](7mls.md)  or by [security level](7je8.md) 3 users on a [Central System](7mls.md). |
