# Upload Form 
---

The Upload form allows information entered and [downloaded](<7mr4.md>) at one workstation to be 
transferred to another.&nbsp; It provides users that do not have network access 
the ability to maintain a [centralized database](<7mnk.md>).&nbsp; 
To bring up the Upload form select the Administrator - Upload menu item on the
[main form](<7jjr.md>).

The 
upload functions that are enabled are controlled by the [system type](<7mls.md>) and by the user's [security level](<7je8.md>).&nbsp; 
Security levels 1 and 2 are only allowed to upload evaluations.&nbsp; On a stand-alone 
system only trainers/supervisors, trainees/employees and criteria sets can be 
uploaded.

To perform an upload select the type of upload to perform.&nbsp; An Open 
window will appear.&nbsp; Use the Open window to locate and select the file containing the data to 
  be uploaded.&nbsp; Click on the Open button to start the upload.&nbsp; An 
incorrect file type selection will result in an error dialog.&nbsp; To abort the 
upload select Cancel.

During the upload a progress bar appears at the bottom of the window to indicate the status.&nbsp; Notification appears on the screen when when the upload is completed.&nbsp; Attempting to close the form while an upload is in progress will bring up 
  a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort.

> **NOTE** : <font color="#FF0000">Only those downloaded Zip files from a source database which is configured by the same Expectations version as the destination database are supported in the upload process.</font>&nbsp; The source and destination databases may be either of the two database types in any combination of MS Access or SQL Server.
