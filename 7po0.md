# Upload

***

The Upload form allows information entered and [downloaded](7mr4.md) at one workstation to be transferred to another.  It provides users that do not have network access the ability to maintain a [centralized database](7mnk.md).  To bring up the Upload form select the Administrator - Upload menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

The upload functions that are enabled are controlled by the [system type](7mls.md) and by the user's [security level](7je8.md).  Security levels 1 and 2 are only allowed to upload evaluations.  On a stand-alone system only trainers/supervisors, trainees/employees and criteria sets can be uploaded.

To perform an upload select the type of upload to perform.  An Open window will appear.  Use the Open window to locate and select the file containing the data to be uploaded.  Click on the Open button to start the upload.  An incorrect file type selection will result in an error dialog.  To abort the upload select Cancel.

During the upload a progress bar appears at the bottom of the window to indicate the status.  Notification appears on the screen when when the upload is completed.  Attempting to close the form while an upload is in progress will bring up a dialog box, offering the operator an opportunity to abort.

> **NOTE** : Only those downloaded Zip files from a source database which is configured by the same Expectations version as the destination database are supported in the upload process.  The source and destination databases may be either of the two database types in any combination of MS Access or SQL Server.
