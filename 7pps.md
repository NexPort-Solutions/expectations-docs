# Evaluation Techniques 
-----

Evaluation of employee performance and behavior is seen as a "necessary evil."  Employees generally do not like the process, and supervisors see it as something that has to be done once a year.

With this system, the employee is evaluated in an objective manner using standardized evaluation guidelines every month or every quarter.  These evaluations reflect the employee's performance and behavior for the month or quarter, and not only document poor performance and behavior, but also highlight acceptable and exceptional performance and behavior.

As a performance feedback device, monthly or bimonthly evaluations can work wonders for positive employee morale.  Timely recognition of tasks done well motivates employees to try harder.  Although it may seem hard to believe, employees who are provided timely feedback on unacceptable or marginal performance or behavior will react positively, trying to improve for the next evaluation.

Supervisors are guided through the evaluation process with all criteria for evaluation guidelines shown on the screen.  Comments are easily added to illustrate the rating given the employee in each category.  The criteria for each position is provided in writing to the employee when he or she enters the position, so the employee knows not only *what* will be evaluated, but also *what degree* of performance he or she must attain.

This program provides a number of categories generic to most jobs.  These include personal appearance, knowledge and application of policies and procedures, and relationships with others.  You as the Program Coordinator must customize the employee's evaluation criteria to the individual position that is to be evaluated.  This personalizes the evaluation to that person, and further validates the evaluation process.

How do you customize these evaluation criteria?  First, you have to understand how the criteria work . . . then you can begin to design criteria from individual job descriptions.
