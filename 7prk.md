# Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation 
---

These guidelines are designed to give the trainer/supervisor specific guidelines by which to objectively evaluate behavior and performance.  These guidelines ensure the trainer's/supervisor's evaluation tool is considered valid and reliable.

If you take into consideration the default rating categories supplied in the software, each is divided into three segments of observable behavior or performance.  The rating of "1' denotes the worst possible behavior or performance that can be expected for that category.  A rating of "4" denotes behavior or performance that is acceptable, but the lowest level of behavior or performance that is considered acceptable.  A rating of "7" indicates the highest level of performance that can be expected for the category.

The Seven-Point Scale defines three levels (1, 4, and 7) while leaving four other points on the scale (2, 3, 5, and 6) to allow the evaluator some latitude in grading.  If behavior or performance is slightly better than a "1," the rating should be a "2." If behavior or performance is slightly less than a "4," the rating should be a "3."  If behavior or performance is slightly better than a "4," the rating should be a "5."  If behavior or performance is slightly less than a "7," the rating should be a "6."

The important factor that must be considered when using the Seven - Point Scale is that different evaluators are able to uniformly recognize and evaluate unacceptable behavior and performance as well as acceptable behavior and performance.  For example two different supervisors may observe the same behavior or performance.  They may disagree as to whether what they each observed should be graded as a "2" or a "3," but they agree that the behavior or performance is unacceptable.  Similarly, if they disagree as to whether the observed behavior or performance is a "4" or a "5," they do agree that the employee is acceptable in that category.

The "4" rating described in the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation should clearly define the line between "acceptable" and "unacceptable."  If two different supervisors watch performance that one rates as a "3" while the other rates as a "5," there is a problem.  While there may be different gradients on the scale, it is most important that all evaluators see behavior and performance as definitely "acceptable or "unacceptable."  Where the rating lies within these ranges is not as important as it is to uniformly recognize acceptable vs. unacceptable behavior.

To ensure ratings are consistent from day to day and from supervisor to supervisor, the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation must be used every time an evaluation is prepared.  Consistency and objectivity are enhanced when the guidelines are directly used while preparing an evaluation.  If there is a dispute or question with an employee over a rating in a certain category, the values defined in the guidelines should show whether the rating matches observed behavior or performance.  That is why the software displays the evaluation guidelines for each category right on the screen.

Employees are to be provided with a copy of the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation that pertains to their job in advance of the actual evaluation.  Employees cannot be expected to meet and/or exceed defined standards without knowing what those standards are.  New employees should be issued a copy of the guidelines during the first few days of employment, during the orientation phase.  They should also be familiarized with the employee evaluation system and its use.
