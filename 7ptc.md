# Writing your own Evaluation Criteria 
-----

The software provides generic categories for evaluation, but you will have to create evaluation criteria to match items on the job description.  This personalizes the evaluation and helps give the employee specific feedback on particular job tasks.

To write these criteria, obtain a copy of the job description and look at the items found there.  From these items, determine which should be evaluated.  Write down each of these items on a separate sheet, leaving a three to five inch space under each.

Under each item, write a title for the criteria.  For example, if the job description says, "Prepare correspondence within the department," the title for this category would be "Prepare Correspondence".  Then describe the behavior and/or performance that is to be rated in this category, such as, "Evaluates the employee's ability to prepare correspondence for use within the department, according to agency guidelines, policies and procedures."

Next, write "4", and describe the performance and/or behavior that would represent the Minimal level of acceptable performance. Using our example, this statement might be "Prepares correspondence for use within the department on the proper forms, are generally neat and clean with proper grammar, punctuation and/or spelling, according to policies and procedures." This description then equates to the minimum acceptable performance under this category.

Now write a number "1" on the page, and describe the worst possible behavior and/or performance for this category.  This may be, "Employee refuses to or cannot prepare correspondence according to policy and procedure.  Correspondence has numerous grammar, punctuation and/or spelling errors.  Documents have an unprofessional appearance."  This describes the worst possible performance and/or behavior that the employee could display.  It represents the "bottom of the barrel."

Now write a number "7" on the page and describe the best possible behavior and/or performance for this category.  This may be, "Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence according to policy and procedure.  Correspondence is completely free of grammar, punctuation and spelling errors.  Documents have an extremely professional appearance." This describes the best possible performance and/or behavior that the employee could display.  It marks the best of the best.

Your page should look like this:

Prepare Correspondence *Evaluates the employee's ability to prepare correspondence for use within the department, according to agency guidelines, policies and procedures.*

1Employee refuses to or cannot prepare correspondence according to policy

and procedure.  Correspondence has numerous grammar, punctuation and/

or spelling errors.  Documents have an unprofessional appearance.

4Prepares correspondence for use within the department on the proper forms,

are generally neat and clean with proper grammar, punctuation and/or spelling,

according to policies and procedures.

7Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence

according to policy and procedure.  Correspondence is completely free of

grammar, punctuation and spelling errors.  Documents have an extremely

professional appearance.

Congratulations! You have now created the 1-4-7 evaluation criteria for an evaluation category.

Do this for each of the items that you find on the job description.  Massage them to be consistent and objective.  Then go to the administration section of the software and enter the information in a customized criteria set.  (See the section on the manual on *editing criteria.)*

Print the criteria set and distribute it to the employee before beginning the evaluation process.
