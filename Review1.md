# Review Evaluation

***

The Trainer/Supervisor form Review Evaluation tab is accessed via the Trainer/Supervisor - Review Evaluation menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

The window will display a list of Evaluations that the logged in supervisor is assigned to review, ordered by the date and time they were submitted.  The list shows the Trainer/Supervisor who wrote the evaluation, the Trainee/Employee for which the evaluation was written, and the submittal date.  Select an evaluation from the window and then click the Review Evaluation button to open the Review Evaluation window.  Clicking the Close button will close this window.

The Evaluation Reviewer window includes the following three tabs: the [Trainee/Employee Information tab](7ddc.md), the [Trainee/Employee Evaluation tab](7ddh.md), and the Reviewer Comments tab.  Operation of the first two tabs is the same as on the [Evaluation Viewer](7ddc.md).  They are used by the reviewer to look over the evaluation.  After the evaluation has been checked, any comments the reviewer might have are entered on the Reviewer Comments tab.  It includes the "Comments" (read-only) and "New" (editable) textboxes, as well as options for approving and disapproving the evaluation.  Use the Spelling button to spell check the comments before submitting.  Select the Submit button after the comments have been entered and the approval state has been set:

Evaluation comments will also show up in the [Evaluation Writer](7dbq.md) when it is sent back for correcting, the Evaluation Viewer once approved by all reviewers, and in the evaluation report preview and print-off when configured to do so from the [Reviewer Comments](revcom.md) sub-tab.

**NOTE**: Until all reviewers have approved the evaluation, or unless turned off in the Unapproved Evaluations configuration sub-tab of the Global Settings tab, DRAFT will appear across each page of the report when printing or previewing.

The Signatures tab will appear in the Evaluation Reviewer to allow an evaluation to be signed by the reviewer when the "Allow completed evaluations to be signed before they are fully-reviewed" checkbox is checked (in the [Signatures](sig.md) sub-tab of the [System Utilities](7mk0.md) form's [Global Settings](globset.md) tab).

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: If the "Allow completed evaluations to be signed before they are fully-reviewed" checkbox is checked , a confirmation prompt will appear for reviewers when they disapprove evaluations.  Choosing 'Yes' at the following prompt will cause all existing signatures to be cleared and the Signatures tab to disappear, since the evaluation is no longer in the 'Complete' state:
