# Global Settings Tab: Email Notifications 
---

To open the Email Notifications sub-tab of the 
[Global Settings tab](<globset.md>), start by selecting the Global Settings menu item from the Administrator menu on the
[main form](<7jjr.md>).

Expectations email notifications may be enabled by first [configuring the Expectations Email Service](<emailinfra.md>).&nbsp; The service also requires [user setup](<emailbuslog.md>) to establish when notifications are to go out, and to select the recipients.&nbsp; After the email service and users are configured, the following link provides information on [how it works](<emailguide.md>).
