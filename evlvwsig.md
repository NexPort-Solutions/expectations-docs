# Evaluation Viewer: Signatures Tab 
-----

**Evaluation Viewer Tabs**

The Evaluation Viewer appears with the following tabs:

- [Trainee/Employee Information](<7ddc.md>)
- [Trainee/Employee Evaluation](<7ddh.md>)
- [Reviewer Comments](<7ddr.md>)
- Signatures

**Signatures Tab**

By default, the Signatures tab only appears after all reviewers have approved the evaluation.&nbsp; Signatures are listed in the Signers section at the top of the tab and are entered from the Signee area below.

| <font size="3"><b>NOTE</b>:  If the &quot;Allow completed evaluations to be signed before they are fully-reviewed&quot; checkbox is checked (in the <a href="sig.htm">Signatures</a> sub-tab of the <a href="7mk0.htm">System Utilities</a> form's <a href="globset.htm">Global Settings</a> tab), the Signatures tab will also appear in the Evaluation Viewer for those evaluations which have not yet been fully-reviewed.</font> |

**Signers**

A list of signatures is seen in the Signers section of the tab.&nbsp; Each 
signature is validated as it is entered into the list and is shown with a name, 
date and colored background.&nbsp; Green indicates a valid signature while red 
indicates the signature has somehow become corrupted.&nbsp; A signer's remarks 
will appear in the Comments box when their signature is selected in the list.&nbsp; <font size="3">
The signatures in the Signers list also appear on the last page of the report 
when printing or previewing.</font>

**Signee**

Signatures are entered from the Signee area of the tab.&nbsp; It is enabled 
when the following conditions are met:

- A signature key has been created for the current user.
- The current user has not already signed the evaluation.
- The current user is either:
    - the individual being evaluated
    - the author of the evaluation
    - one of the reviewers

Remarks can be entered into the Comments box and spell checked with the 
spelling button.&nbsp; To sign the evaluation select the Sign button.&nbsp; A 
Browse For Folder dialog window will then open.

Use the Browse For Folder to locate the folder containing the signature key.&nbsp; 
The signature key can be either on the local PC, somewhere on the network, or on 
a memory stick.&nbsp; Once the key folder is located, select the OK button.&nbsp; 
A dialog window appears to indicate whether or not the signature was successful.&nbsp; 
If so, then the signature is added to the list.

| <font size="3"><b>NOTE</b>:  Upon clicking &quot;Sign&quot;, the folder browser will <b>not</b> appear in the case where the &quot;Disable browsing for Signatures folder&quot; option is checked in the <a href="sig.htm">Signatures</a> sub-tab of the Global Settings tab.&amp;nbsp; Instead, an attempt will be made to find and use the user's signature key in the path specified as the &quot;Default Signatures folder&quot; (also configurable in the sub-tab).</font> |
