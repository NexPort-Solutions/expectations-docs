# Local Preferences Tab:     Font Sub-Tab 
---

To open the Font sub-tab of the 
[Local Preferences tab](<locpref.md>), start by selecting the Local Preferences menu item from the File menu on the
[main 
form](<7jjr.md>).

The Font sub-tab consists of:

- a "Font Size" combobox, where font point sizes from 8.25 to 15.00 may be selected to scale the font of most user interface windows and controls

A change to the 10.50 font point size (for example) results in the immediate scaling of open windows and their controls to accommodate the change:

Note that the last change made to the font size will be remembered and used by default the next time anyone launches Expectations on the particular workstation where it was set.
