-----

To open the Global Settings tab on the 
[System 
Utilities form](<7mk0.md>), select the Global Settings menu item from the Administrator menu on the
[main 
form](<7jjr.md>).

The Global Settings tab contains the Forced Comments, Report Header, Reviewer Comments, Unapproved Evaluations, Ordering, Signatures, Ratings, and Email Notifications sub-tabs.  These sub-tabs are accessible from either the list on the left or by directly clicking on the sub-tab's header, and consist of controls which allow for:

- the enforcing of comments for specified ratings
- the ability to specify an organization title to include in evaluation reports
- a way to turn reviewer comments on or off in evaluation reports
- the 'DRAFT' watermark to be included or not in unapproved evaluation reports, and unapproved evaluations to appear (or not) in the [View Evaluation](<7d85.md>) tab of the [Trainer/Supervisor Form](<7d68.md>)
- a means to adjust how evaluations are sorted and viewed in the [View Evaluation](<7d85.md>) tab of the [Trainer/Supervisor](<7d68.md>) and [Trainee/Employee](<trneform.md>) forms
- the signatures folder browser to be turned on or off when creating keys or signing evaluations, the default signatures folder path to be defined, the signature comments to be included or not in an evaluation report, and signatures to be added (or not) to evaluations which have not yet been fully-reviewed
- ratings and their characteristics to be added, modified, and deleted prior to adding new criteria
as well as...- email notifications to be turned on/off and configured in conjunction with the Expectations Email Service.

The configuration options found in Global Settings are used to set how Expectations works for all who make use of a particular local or centralized database.
