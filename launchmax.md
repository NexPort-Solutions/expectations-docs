# Local Preferences Tab:     Launch Maximized Sub-Tab 
---

To open the Launch Maximized sub-tab of the 
[Local Preferences tab](<locpref.md>), start by selecting the Local Preferences menu item from the File menu on the
[main 
form](<7jjr.md>).

The Launch Maximized sub-tab consists of:

- a "Maximize main window upon launch" checkbox which, when checked, causes subsequent launches of the application to be in full screen mode

Note that the last change made to the "Maximize main window upon launch" checkbox will be remembered and used by default the next time anyone launches Expectations on the particular workstation where it was checked or unchecked.
