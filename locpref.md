# System Utilities Form:     Local Preferences Tab 
---

To open the Local Preferences tab on the 
[System 
Utilities form](<7mk0.md>), select the Local Preferences menu item from the File menu on the
[main 
form](<7jjr.md>).

The Local Preferences tab contains the Font and Launch Maximized sub-tabs.  These sub-tabs are accessible from either the list on the left or by directly clicking on the sub-tab's header, and consist of controls which allow for:

- the ability to change the font size used for most user interface windows and controls
and...- the ability to change whether or not the application will launch in full screen mode

The configuration options found in Local Preferences are used to set how Expectations works for all users on a particular workstation.

See these topics for more information on the Local Preferences sub-tabs:

- [Launch Maximized](<launchmax.md>)
