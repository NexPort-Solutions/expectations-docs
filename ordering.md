# Global Settings Tab:     Ordering Sub-Tab 
-----

To open the Ordering sub-tab of the 
[Global Settings tab](<globset.md>), start by selecting the Global Settings menu item from the Administrator menu on the
[main 
form](<7jjr.md>).

The Ordering sub-tab provides options for how to sort and label evaluations listed in the [View Evaluation](<7d85.md>) tab of the [Trainer/Supervisor Form](<7d68.md>).&nbsp; By default, each trainee's evaluations are sorted and labeled by the "To Date":&nbsp;

The "Sort by:" radio button selection may be adjusted to affect how evaluations are ordered, based off of the original values specified in the [Evaluation Writer](<7dbk.md>):

- **Completed Date** - located at the top right of the [Trainee/Employee Evaluation Tab](<7dbp.md>)
- **From Date** - located in the top right corner of the [Trainee/Employee Information Tab](<7dbk.md>) page's 'Evaluation Data' section
- **To Date** - just below the 'From Date' in the [Trainee/Employee Information Tab](<7dbk.md>) page's 'Evaluation Data' section
- **Evaluation #** - located at the top left of the [Trainee/Employee Information Tab](<7dbk.md>) page's 'Evaluation Data' section

The "View:" options may be adjusted to affect the label appearance of evaluations listed in the [View Evaluation](<7d85.md>) tab.&nbsp; The **Completed Date**, **From Date**, and **To Date** radio buttons are also based upon the corresponding fields of the [Evaluation Writer](<7dbk.md>), and the **No Date** radio button may be selected to turn off the visible date portion of an evaluation's label.&nbsp; An adjustment to the selected View option controls what appears immediately to the right of the evaluation's list number, if anything.&nbsp; Any of the four radio button selections can be accompanied by the value of the Evaluation # (if available on a given evaluation) by checking the **Include Evaluation #** checkbox.

Following is an example of how the View Evaluation tab's list of evaluations on a trainee appears after having adjusted the "Ordering" sub-tab's selections to sort by their **From Date**, view by their **Completed Date**, and with the **Include Evaluation #** checkbox checked (to have it appear to the far right in the evaluation label):

Here's how those same evaluations appear in the list when sorting by one of the four 'Sort by' options, selecting "No Date" as the 'View' option, and ensuring that "Include Evaluation #" is not checked:
