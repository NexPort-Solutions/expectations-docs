# Trainer/Supervisor Form:     Print Worksheet Tab 
---

The Trainer/Supervisor form Print Worksheet tab is accessed via the 
Trainer/Supervisor - Print Worksheet menu item on the [main form](<7jjr.md>).

To print a worksheet, first make a selection from the list of trainees/employees available to the user.&nbsp; This list may include all trainees/employees if the current user is assigned to ['Department ALL'](<7mls.md>).&nbsp; Once selected, the default criteria set for the trainee/employee is entered into the Criteria Set box.&nbsp; This is the criteria set that will be used to create the worksheet.&nbsp; To change the criteria set, make another selection from the 
drop down list.&nbsp; The Blank Comment Lines counter varies the number of blank 
lines appearing for each comment.&nbsp; Selecting the Print Worksheet 
button loads the worksheet into the Report Preview window.&nbsp; Clicking the Close button closes 
the Trainer/Supervisor window.

Use the Report Preview window to check out the worksheet and make adjustments 
before printing.&nbsp; Selecting the Print Report button, having an image of a 
printer on the face, opens a Print dialog window from which the printer is 
selected and the document finally printed.
