# Print Worksheet

***

The Trainer/Supervisor form Print Worksheet tab is accessed via the Trainer/Supervisor - Print Worksheet menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

To print a worksheet, first make a selection from the list of trainees/employees available to the user.  This list may include all trainees/employees if the current user is assigned to ['Department ALL'](7mls.md).  Once selected, the default criteria set for the trainee/employee is entered into the Criteria Set box.  This is the criteria set that will be used to create the worksheet.  To change the criteria set, make another selection from the drop down list.  The Blank Comment Lines counter varies the number of blank lines appearing for each comment.  Selecting the Print Worksheet button loads the worksheet into the Report Preview window.  Clicking the Close button closes the Trainer/Supervisor window.

Use the Report Preview window to check out the worksheet and make adjustments before printing.  Selecting the Print Report button, having an image of a printer on the face, opens a Print dialog window from which the printer is selected and the document finally printed.
