The Certification Viewer is accessed via the Certifications -&gt; View menu item on the main form, or via the Ctrl+T keyboard hotkey.

The Certification Viewer form consists of a combobox where a Training Individual may be selected, and the Certification and Status columns which populate (as available) with current and past certification-based training statuses for a selected training individual.&nbsp; 'In Progress' statuses appear alphanumerically by certification name at the top of the training individual's list.&nbsp; The 'Completed' statuses appear immediately after the 'In Progress' statuses, and completed statuses are arranged by date from most to least recent.

Trainees/Employees have the ability to view their own certification-based training statuses, and Trainers/Supervisors have access to the statuses of all training individuals.&nbsp; Certification-based training is designated as such in the [Training Requirements Editor](<tdedit.md>), and is assigned to other training individuals in the [Training Requirements Manager](<tdmanage.md>), by level 3 Trainers/Supervisors.&nbsp; An assigned certification-based training program is considered 'In Progress' if it is marked anything less than fully completed and reviewed, and 'Completed' after having been marked as fully completed and reviewed.&nbsp; These certification-based program item requirements may be marked as fulfilled through the use of the Progress and Completed tabs of the [Training Requirements Manager](<tdmanage.md>).&nbsp; A Trainee/Employee may mark completed certification-based program items as reviewed in the Completed tab of the [Training Requirements Reviewer](<tdreview.md>).
