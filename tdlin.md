# Logging In 
-----

In order to review, manage, or edit training requirements, or view certifications, a user first needs to log in.&nbsp; This is accomplished from the Login form.&nbsp; The Login form is accessed via the Login - Login menu item on the [main form](<tdmain.md>).

The Login form will automatically appear when the Training & Development application first starts up and establishes a database connection, or when a user logs out.&nbsp; On a machine where the Expectations suite is installed for the first time, both applications have a single Trainer/Supervisor account provided by default; the Login Name being "Admin" and the Password "password".&nbsp; To log in, enter the Login Name, Password and User Type in the appropriate boxes and select the OK button.&nbsp; User information appears on the status bar at the bottom of the [main form](<tdmain.md>), and the menus are reconfigured to accommodate the user's [security level](<7gj4.md>) (specified in the Expectations main application).&nbsp; The Cancel button will close the Login form without logging in.

When Training & Development is unable to establish a database connection at startup, the login form will not appear.&nbsp; Please use the procedure at the bottom of the [Database Connection](<tddbconn.md>) help topic for more information on adjusting the database connection properties.&nbsp; Once the connection is made to the database, the Login form will appear.

> **NOTE** : For instructions on setting the database connection for both applications, see the first procedure in the [Database Connection](<tddbconn.md>) help topic. |
