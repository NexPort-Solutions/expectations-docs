# Logging In

***

In order to review, manage, or edit training requirements, or view certifications, a user first needs to log in.  This is accomplished from the Login form.  The Login form is accessed via the Login - Login menu item on the [main form](tdmain.md).

The Login form will automatically appear when the Training & Development application first starts up and establishes a database connection, or when a user logs out.  On a machine where the Expectations suite is installed for the first time, both applications have a single Trainer/Supervisor account provided by default; the Login Name being "Admin" and the Password "password".  To log in, enter the Login Name, Password and User Type in the appropriate boxes and select the OK button.  User information appears on the status bar at the bottom of the [main form](tdmain.md), and the menus are reconfigured to accommodate the user's [security level](7gj4.md) (specified in the Expectations main application).  The Cancel button will close the Login form without logging in.

When Training & Development is unable to establish a database connection at startup, the login form will not appear.  Please use the procedure at the bottom of the [Database Connection](tddbconn.md) help topic for more information on adjusting the database connection properties.  Once the connection is made to the database, the Login form will appear.

> **NOTE** : For instructions on setting the database connection for both applications, see the first procedure in the [Database Connection](tddbconn.md) help topic.
