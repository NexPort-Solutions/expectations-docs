# Main Form

The main form is the parent form of the Training & Development application.  All the other forms are limited to operate within the bounds of the main form.  At the top of the form are the main menus.  Within the main menus are the menu items that access the other forms.  Menu items may or may not be enabled, depending on if a user has logged in and what their security level is.  Enabled menu items are indicated by black text, disabled menu items by gray text.  User information displays on the status bar at the bottom of the form.  To exit the Training & Development application, select the control box X or the File - Exit menu item.
