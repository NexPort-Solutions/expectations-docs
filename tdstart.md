# Startup

***

To start the Training & Development application, select the shortcut on the desktop or in the Start menu.  The splash screen is displayed when the [main form](tdmain.md) first appears.  Clicking on the splash screen will make it go away.

The Training & Development application attempts to establish a database connection upon launch.  If successful, the [Login form](tdlin.md) appears after the splash screen goes away.  If the Training & Development application is unable to establish a database connection, please see the section entitled [Database Connection](tddbconn.md) in order to adjust the database connection properties.
