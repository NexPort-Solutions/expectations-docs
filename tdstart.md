To start the Training & Development application, select the shortcut on the 
desktop or in the Start menu.&nbsp; The splash screen is displayed when the [main form](<tdmain.md>) 
first appears.&nbsp; Clicking on the splash screen will make it go away.

The Training & Development application attempts to establish a database connection upon launch.&nbsp; 
If successful, the [Login form](<tdlin.md>) appears after the splash screen goes away.&nbsp; If the Training & Development application is unable to establish a database connection, please see the section entitled [Database Connection](<tddbconn.md>) in order to adjust the database connection properties.
