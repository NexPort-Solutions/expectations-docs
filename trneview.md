# View Evaluation

***

The Trainee/Employee form View Evaluation tab is accessed via the Trainee/Employee - View Evaluation menu item on the [main form](7jjr.md).

There are two boxes displayed on the screen.  The Trainee/Employee box displays the individual's name and the Completed Evaluations box is initially blank.  Selecting the name in the Trainee/Employee box fills the Completed Evaluations box with a list of sequentially numbered evaluations, sorted by the completion date.  Checking the "Highlight Fully-Signed Evaluations" checkbox will apply a green highlight to those evaluations which have been signed by the trainer, the trainee, and all reviewers assigned to the trainer at the time the evaluations were originally saved.

At the bottom left of the tab, the View Evaluation button remains disabled until an evaluation is selected.  When depressed, the evaluation is opened in the [Evaluation Viewer](7ddc.md).  Clicking the Close button will close this window.
