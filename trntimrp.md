# Training Time Report

***

## Training Time Report Window

The Training Time Report window is used to view trainee/employee training hours.  It is launched from the [Reports tab of the Trainer/Supervisor window](7d9s.md).  Located on the window is a toolbar with five buttons at the top and a list of employees below.

## Trainee/Employee List

The trainee/employee list is ordered by last and first name.  If a trainee/employee is active, the text will be black. An inactive trainee/employee is indicated by red text.  Use the All, Active and Inactive buttons on the left side of the toolbar to display either all trainees/employees, active only or inactive only.

## Training Time

A "+" symbol appears to the left of the trainees/employees for which evaluations have been written.  When the "+" symbol is selected, the training time for each criteria set a trainee/employee was evaluated on is displayed below their name.  A "-" symbol will then appear next to the trainee/employee name.  To hide the training time, select the "-" symbol.  Training time is entered on the [Trainee/Employee Information tab of the Evaluation Writer](7dbk.md).

## Printed Report

The Print button sends a formatted report to the default printer based on what trainees/employees are currently being displayed.  Select the Preview button to view the report prior to printing.  The report opens in the Report Preview window.  To print the report from the Report Preview window, select the Print Report button with an image of a printer on the face.
