<u>Training Time Report Window</u>

The Training Time Report window is used to view trainee/employee training 
hours.&nbsp; It is launched from the [Reports tab of the 
Trainer/Supervisor window](<7d9s.md>).&nbsp; Located on the window is a 
toolbar with five buttons at the top and a list of employees below.

<u>Trainee/Employee List</u>

The trainee/employee list is ordered by 
last and first name.&nbsp; If a trainee/employee is active, the text will 
be black. An inactive trainee/employee is indicated by red text.&nbsp; Use the 
All, Active and Inactive buttons on the left side of the toolbar to display either 
all trainees/employees, active only or inactive only.

<u>Training Time</u>

A "+" symbol appears to the left of the trainees/employees for which 
evaluations have been written.&nbsp; When the "+" symbol is selected, the 
training time for each criteria set a trainee/employee was evaluated on is 
displayed below their name.&nbsp; A "-" symbol will then appear next to the 
trainee/employee name.&nbsp; To hide the training time, select the "-" symbol.&nbsp; 
Training time is entered on the [Trainee/Employee 
Information tab of the Evaluation Writer](<7dbk.md>).

<u>Printed Report</u>

The Print button sends a formatted 
report to the default printer based on what trainees/employees are currently 
being displayed.&nbsp; Select the Preview button to view the report prior to 
printing.&nbsp; The report opens in the Report Preview window.&nbsp; To print 
the report from the Report Preview window, select the Print Report button with an image of a printer on the face.
